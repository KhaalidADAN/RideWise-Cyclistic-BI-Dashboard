# **RideWise: Cyclistic Insights Dashboard**
## **Project Overview**
The **RideWise** project is a business intelligence (BI) dashboard designed for **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-sharing company based in New York City. The dashboard provides valuable insights into customer behavior, bike station demand, and usage patterns, helping Cyclistic optimize their services and grow their customer base.

This project is designed to showcase my data analysis, visualization, and BI development skills, as well as my ability to manage a project from the requirements phase to final implementation.

## **Dataset Information**
- **Primary dataset**: NYC Citi Bike Trips — Contains data on bike trips including start/end times, locations (latitude/longitude), customer types (subscribers vs. non-subscribers), and trip duration.
- **Secondary dataset**: Census Bureau US Boundaries — Provides geographic information like zip codes, neighborhoods, and boroughs to enhance location-based analysis.

## **Features**
1. **Customer Segmentation**: 
   - Differentiates between subscribers and non-subscribers, allowing the marketing and customer growth teams to understand usage patterns and create targeted campaigns.
   
2. **Station Demand Analysis**: 
   - Identifies which bike stations have the highest demand, enabling Cyclistic to optimize station locations and manage bike availability.

3. **Time-Based Usage Trends**:
   - Provides insights into peak usage times by hour, day, and season, allowing for better resource allocation and strategic planning.

4. **Year-over-Year Growth**:
   - Visualizes trip growth trends over the years, helping management assess business performance and plan for future expansion.

5. **Weather Impact Analysis**:
   - Shows how weather conditions, particularly precipitation, affect bike usage patterns.

6. **Accessibility**:
   - Dashboard designed with accessibility in mind, including large fonts and text-to-speech options for visually impaired users.

## **Technology and Tools**
- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard development.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Excel**: For initial data exploration.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For analysis documentation.
  
## **Visualizations**
The dashboard includes:
- **Map of Bike Stations**: Visualizes station locations and congestion levels.
- **Line Chart for Peak Trip Times**: Shows bike usage trends by hour and season.
- **Bar Chart for Year-over-Year Growth**: Displays trip growth over multiple years.
